# what is this config's purpose. The python doesn't have a compiler, we can not check the syntax issue. That is reason why I have this config which help we check syntax before running project

- install 3 libraries: ruff, mypy, pytest
  poetry add --group dev ruff mypy pytest

# run manually:
poetry run mypy .
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run pytest

# run automatically
Step 1: Create folder tools, and check.py inside it.
import subprocess, sys

def main():
    cmds = [
        ["ruff", "check", "src", "tests"],
        ["mypy", "src"],
        ["pytest", "-q"]
    ]
    for cmd in cmds:
        print(f"\n▶ Running: {' '.join(cmd)}")
        result = subprocess.run(cmd)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            print(f"❌ Failed: {' '.join(cmd)}")
            sys.exit(result.returncode)
    print("\n✅ All checks passed successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Step 2: add config into the pyproject.toml
  [tool.mypy]
mypy_path = "src"
explicit_package_bases = true
  
Step 3: run 2 commands below  
poetry install
poetry run check

Finally: If you see the progress as below. which mean it worked
▶ Running: ruff check .
▶ Running: mypy .
▶ Running: pytest
✅ All checks passed successfully!
